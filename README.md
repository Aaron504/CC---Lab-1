- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Creating the Resource Group</h2>

- Navigate to the Azure Portal.
- Select "Resource groups" from the left-hand menu.
- Click on "Add" to create a new resource group.
- Provide a unique name for the resource group.
- Choose the appropriate subscription.
- Select the desired region (Azure region where the resources will be deployed).
